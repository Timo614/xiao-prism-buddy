/// Statement of Purpose
///
/// The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
/// exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
/// and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
/// authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
///
/// Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
/// the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
/// scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
/// of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
/// works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
/// and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
/// These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
/// culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
/// works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
/// part through the use and efforts of others.
///
/// For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
/// expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
/// associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
/// is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
/// elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
/// terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
/// Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
///
/// 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
/// protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
/// Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
/// limited to, the following:
///
///   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
///      communicate, and translate a Work;
///  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
/// iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
///      likeness depicted in a Work;
///  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
///      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
///   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
///      in a Work;
///  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
///      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
///      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
///      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
///      directive); and
/// vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
///      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
///      implementations thereof.
///
/// 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
/// of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
/// irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
/// Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
/// of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
/// future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
/// worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
/// treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
/// medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
/// including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
/// purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
/// member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
/// successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
/// revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
/// equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
/// as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
///
/// 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
/// be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
/// Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
/// account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
/// extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
/// person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
/// irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
/// Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
/// maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
/// time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
/// of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
/// limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
/// "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
/// applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
/// reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
/// partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
/// of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
/// will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
/// Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
/// action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
/// express Statement of Purpose.
///
/// 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
///
///  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
///     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
///  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
///     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
///     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
///     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
///     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
///     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
///     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
///  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
///     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
///     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
///     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
///     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
///     Work.
///  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
///     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
///     this CC0 or use of the Work.
